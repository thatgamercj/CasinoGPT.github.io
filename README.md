# Crash Game

A simple casino-style game hosted on GitHub Pages.

### How to Play:
1. Enter a bet amount.
2. Click 'Place Bet' to start the game.
3. Watch the multiplier increase.
4. Cash out before the game crashes to win your bet multiplied by the displayed value.
5. If you don’t cash out in time, the game will crash and you’ll lose your bet.

### Provably Fair:
The game is provably fair by generating a crash point based on a hash value. Each round has an unpredictable yet verifiable crash point.
